Music Mart Insights: Analyzed music store data using SQL. Uncovered employee performance, customer behaviors, and music preferences. Mastered SQL joins, group by, and subqueries for advanced analysis
Through my Music Mart Insights project, I learned a lot about SQL, a computer language for handling data. It was like solving puzzles with information from the music store. By doing this project, I got really good at using SQL because I had to learn new things like joining different pieces of data, grouping similar data, and using subqueries.

This project was like a big training ground for me. Every problem I solved helped me understand SQL better. Now, I feel confident in my SQL skills and know how to use them in real-life situations. Thanks to Music Mart Insights, I'm ready to tackle any data challenge that comes my way!
